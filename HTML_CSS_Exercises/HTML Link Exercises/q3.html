Kerala has been aptly dubbed "God's Own Country".The Kerala backwaters are a beautiful, blissful location. Quaint houseboats glide across palm-fringed emerald waters, you can spot unique flora and fauna, go kayaking, and in between indulge in lip-smacking food cooked by talented on-board chefs. The best places to head to catch a backwater cruise are Alleppey, Kumarakom, Kollam, Kasaragod and Kuttanad.<br>
With more than 25 wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, Kerala is a perfect place to spot wild animals, migratory birds and raw nature while on a wildlife safari. Some popular places are the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary , Parambikulam Tiger Reserve , Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary , Mathikettan Shola National Park and Periyar Tiger Reserve.<br>
The spice, coffee and tea plantations in Kerala offer picturesque vistas and delicious tastes. There are many coffee, tea and spice plantations spread across the state, with the best ones at Munnar, Wayanad and Thekkady. You can sample different teas or enjoy a refreshing cup of coffee while soaking in the natural beauty.<br>
